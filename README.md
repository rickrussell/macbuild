## Introduction

The goal of this project is fully automate my OS X Yosemite workstation using
Ansible.  I have currently implemented the following:

* **OS X Defaults**: Updating of plist properties for various aspects of OS X
  such as enabling zoom, configuring Finder and so on.  This uses a custom
  plist module which allows for complex updates of plist files far beyond
  the defaults command.
* **Configuration Files**: Any files that are to be copied to the Mac,
  including app settings, licenses and dotfiles.
* **Symlinks to Cloud Storage**: This allows you to store certain app
  configuration in the cloud (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive .etc) and then
  symlink to it so that your settings are stored and updated in the cloud.
* **Unix Package Installation**: This is being accomplish with the use of
  [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew).
* **Terminal Customisation**: Setting up the Terminal using JXA.
* **Desktop Application Installation**: This is being performed with the use
  of [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask).
* **Appstore Application Check**: Since there is currently no way to automate
  installation of App Store applications, I perform a check to see if the app
  is installed, and notify the user that they must install it from the App
  Store if it isn't.
* **Development Setup**: Installation of development languages like Python,
  Ruby, Node.js and Go, along with development environments like docker and
  Vagrant.  This also includes installation of related packages for each
  technology.
* **Application Settings**: Automating configuration of Sublime Text, MacDown,
  Textual and other applications which are of interest to me.  This is performed using plist properties, files and custom code.

The plist module is a modified version of
[Matthias Neugebauer's plist module](https://github.com/mtneug/ansible-modules-plist).

## Quick Start

Run the following in your Terminal to use my configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fgimian/macbuild.git
cd macbuild
./macbuild.sh
```

It is strongly suggested that you reboot your Mac after the first run
of this.

## Manual Configuration

Some settings (outside those in the "Out of Scope") section must be set
manually due to excessive automation complexity.

* **1Password**: Locate your 1Password database (this setting is stored in an
  SQLite database)
* **CanOpener**: Install this manually
* **Chrome**: Sign in with your Google account to sync settings
* **Clear**: Enable iCloud (this triggers various actions which I can't
  automate)
* **Dropbox**: Disable camera uploads (settings are stored a binary)
* **Firefox**: Go through wizard and sign into your Firefox account
* **Microsoft Office**: License this manually
* **Spotify**: Update sources to only include iTunes (settings are stored
  in binary format)
* **ValhallaVintageVerb**: Install this manualy
